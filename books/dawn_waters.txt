Chapter 1: Return to Dawn Waters

Todd Rivers had always thought of Dawn Waters as a sanctuary. A place that held the stillness of nature and the memories of his childhood-before the horror. Before the night he'd been informed of the grotesque attack on his family, the unspeakable violence at the hands of Eskimos. That night had shattered everything. His wife, his children, all defiled and gone.

Now, months later, he stood at the edge of that same lake. Its waters shimmered under the dimming sky, the air heavy with the scent of wet pine and rotting leaves. He had come here to heal, to find peace. But as he stared at the water, a small sound broke through the quiet.

Drip… drip… drip…

He looked around. Nothing. Just the soft, rhythmic patter of water, somewhere nearby.

"What is that constant dripping?" Todd muttered to himself.

He shook his head, trying to brush it off. But the sound lingered in his ears, gnawing at the edges of his thoughts.

Chapter 2: The Hillbilly at the Lake

The next morning, Todd decided to take a swim. The lake, always pristine in his memory, looked more inviting than ever. He stripped down, eager for the cool water to cleanse him, to wash away the filth of his thoughts. But as he waded into the shallows, something caught his eye.

On the far side of the lake, a hunched figure crouched by the water's edge. The man was old-ancient, really-his body bent and twisted like a gnarled root. His clothes hung in filthy rags, barely covering his scarred, withered skin. Todd could make out patches of sores along the man's back, an affliction that screamed of something foul. Syphilis, Todd thought. He'd seen the disease before, during his brief stint as a medic in some long-forgotten conflict.

The old man was scrubbing his bare arse in the water.

Todd froze, disgusted. The serenity of Dawn Waters shattered like glass. He watched as the hillbilly, oblivious to his presence, dunked himself deeper into the lake, splashing the contaminated water over his sores.

"What the hell," Todd whispered to himself, stepping back from the shore. His mouth went dry. This wasn't what he remembered. This wasn't his lake anymore. He turned and ran back to the cabin, the sound of the old man's splashing following him all the way.

Chapter 3: Wet Everywhere

Days passed, but the peace Todd sought never came. Instead, the opposite. He started seeing water everywhere-an unnerving wetness that clung to every aspect of his life.

A glass on the kitchen counter, the water in it untouched, yet he swore it was spilling over the edges. His pillow damp with sweat, as though it had been soaked in rainwater. In the corners of his vision, he caught glimpses of puddles, waterlogged sponges, and dripping faucets, though every tap in the cabin remained dry. It was as if the very essence of Dawn Waters had begun to saturate his existence.

And worse, whenever he drank, the water burned.

At first, he chalked it up to his nerves, the trauma still fresh in his mind. But as the days wore on, the burning grew more intense. It wasn't just the water; it was the feeling of the water. Like each drop was trying to drown him from the inside out.

Chapter 4: The Drip

The dripping sound returned, relentless. It echoed in his ears, a constant, maddening reminder of something he couldn't place. Todd searched the cabin, the woods, the lake's edge. No matter where he went, the drip followed. Always just out of sight, just beyond his reach.

He began to question his sanity. Was this real, or was his mind unravelling like the frayed edges of a worn rope? Every time he sat down, the drip was there. Every time he closed his eyes, he could hear it, feel it. A slow, torturous drop… after drop… after drop.

At night, his dreams became wet. He would wake, gasping for air, feeling as though he had been submerged, drowning in the still, cold waters of the lake. But the most horrifying visions weren't the dreams themselves-it was the sensation that followed him into waking life. That constant, suffocating wetness.

Chapter 5: Contamination

The hillbilly returned. Every day now, Todd saw him at the lake, scrubbing his diseased body in the once-pristine waters. The sight sickened him, but he couldn't look away. He became obsessed with the man, convinced that somehow, he was the cause of Todd's growing madness.

One morning, Todd approached the old man, his voice trembling with rage. "What are you doing here?" he shouted. "You're contaminating everything!"

The hillbilly looked up, his eyes cloudy with age. He smiled, a toothless grin that made Todd's stomach churn.

"Everything's already dirty, son," the old man croaked. "Always has been."

Todd recoiled, stepping back from the shore, but not before the hillbilly reached out with one filthy, dripping hand and grasped Todd's wrist.

"You can't wash it off," the old man rasped. "The water don't clean. It never does."

Chapter 6: The Burning Lake

That night, Todd stood at the lake's edge, his skin itching with a burning sensation. He had to know. He had to understand. Was the hillbilly right? Was the water itself tainted-always had been? He bent down, cupped a handful of lake water, and brought it to his lips.

As soon as the liquid touched his tongue, his throat ignited with a searing heat. He gagged, spitting it out, but the damage was done. His skin flushed red, his veins pulsed with fire. It felt like his insides were boiling.

He fell to the ground, gasping for air. In the distance, he could hear the hillbilly's laughter, faint and hollow, echoing across the water.

Chapter 7: Drowning in Madness

The following days blurred into one long, fevered nightmare. Todd wandered the woods, his thoughts fragmented, his mind dissolving like paper in water. Everywhere he looked, the dripping, the wetness. Even in the driest corners of the cabin, he found puddles pooling at his feet. The water wasn't just outside; it was inside him. He could feel it coursing through his veins, consuming him from within.

He started hearing voices in the water-whispers that echoed with a strange familiarity. His family's voices. The voices of those he had lost, calling to him from beneath the surface of the lake. But their words were distorted, garbled, as though they were speaking from deep under water.

He had to go to them. He had to let the lake take him.

Chapter 8: Dawn Waters Rising

On the final day, Todd stood at the edge of Dawn Waters, staring out over the glassy surface. The sky was a sickly shade of grey, and the air felt thick, almost gelatinous. He took a deep breath and waded into the water, feeling its cold embrace around his legs, his chest, his throat.

As the lake consumed him, he looked down, expecting to see the reflection of the hillbilly, or perhaps his own face twisted by madness. But what he saw was worse. Far worse.

The water wasn't water anymore.

It was blood. Dark, thick, and pulsating with life-his life. It was his family's blood, the blood of the innocent and the damned alike. And now, it was his turn to join them.

With one final, gurgling breath, Todd let himself sink. The waters of Dawn closed over him, cold and eternal.

Epilogue: The Constant Drip

No one ever saw Todd Rivers again. The cabin at Dawn Waters stood abandoned, the lake still and quiet as always. But on certain nights, if you stand by the shore, you can still hear it.

Drip… drip… drip…

And if you listen closely enough, you might just hear the whispers of those lost beneath the surface, calling for someone-anyone-to join them in the water.
