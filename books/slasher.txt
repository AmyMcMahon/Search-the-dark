Title: Slasher
Author: Garth Margeni
Genre: Horror / Thriller

Prologue
The night had a way of swallowing sounds whole, especially in a town like Briar Creek. But the scream was undeniable. Sharp, guttural, it ripped through the forest that bordered the sleepy suburb, carried on the wind for anyone still awake to hear.

There had been five victims already. Each one slaughtered with clinical precision, as though they had been made for this — for the violent moment when life and death meet under the cold edge of a blade. The newspapers had called him "The Slasher of Briar Creek," but this was more than just a nickname. It was a title. A legacy.

And tonight, that legacy was about to grow.

Chapter One: The Rules of the Game
For someone who had never killed before, she certainly looked like a natural.

Leila Grayson knelt over the body of the man sprawled at her feet, a knife still clutched tightly in her trembling hand. His eyes were wide, glassy, his throat slashed open in a savage, efficient line. Blood soaked the ground beneath him, black in the moonlight.

She could hear her heart pounding in her ears, and for a moment, everything else faded — the noise, the smell, even the distant sirens approaching from the highway. It was just her and the body, and the single, disorienting thought swirling in her mind: I didn’t mean to do it.

But it didn’t matter. The damage was done. She had crossed a line she could never uncross.

The voice inside her head was calm, steady. This is how it starts.

Chapter Four: Patterns in Blood
Briar Creek wasn’t known for its mysteries, or its violence. It was a quiet town, the kind people passed through without a second glance. But the murders had changed everything. The media had descended like vultures, feasting on every scrap of information, every whispered rumor.

Leila had always been fascinated by the town's strange, unspoken history, the stories no one wanted to believe. But she had never expected to be part of it.

The Slasher had already claimed five victims. Each one brutalized in exactly the same way — a single slash across the throat, precise and clean, as though whoever did it had learned how to kill somewhere far more deliberate than a back alley or basement.

The cops were no closer to catching him than they had been after the first body turned up. But Leila could feel it in her bones. This wasn’t just about murder. There was a pattern here, something that connected the victims, something only she could see.

And it terrified her.

Chapter Six: The Copycat
The next murder didn’t fit the pattern.

The victim — a young man named Tyler Matthews — wasn’t killed with the same precision as the others. His wounds were sloppier, messier, like whoever had done it had no idea what they were doing. The cops thought it was a copycat, someone trying to ride the wave of fear the Slasher had created.

But Leila knew the truth.

She had done it.

And it wasn’t an accident this time.

The night she killed Tyler, something inside her snapped. The fear, the guilt — it had all melted away, replaced by a sick, twisted sense of power. The first kill had been an accident, a moment of panic when he had attacked her in the dark. But this one... this one had been on purpose.

And it wouldn’t be the last.

Chapter Ten: The Real Slasher
Leila wasn't the only one killing. The real Slasher — the one who had started it all — was still out there, carving his way through the town, each murder more brutal than the last. But now there was a new player in the game: Leila, the reluctant killer, who was slowly realizing that she was no longer in control.

She was being watched. Every step she took, every decision she made, the Slasher was there, guiding her, pushing her to kill again. It was a game, and she had become a pawn. But Leila wasn’t the kind of person to stay on the sidelines for long.

She started digging. Into the history of Briar Creek, into the unsolved murders that stretched back decades, long before the recent killings began. What she found was more horrifying than she could have imagined.

The Slasher wasn’t just one person. It was a mantle, passed down from generation to generation, a twisted tradition that had been haunting the town for over a century. Each killer left behind a protégé, someone to continue the work.

And now, it was Leila’s turn to take up the blade.

Chapter Fifteen: The Ritual
The murders were part of something much larger, something older and darker than any ordinary killing spree. Briar Creek had been built on blood — a ritual that had to be completed every few decades to keep whatever slept beneath the town from waking.

The Slasher was chosen, not born. Each new killer was handpicked, groomed for the role, their mind twisted until they could no longer tell the difference between their own thoughts and the urge to kill. The town’s leaders knew about it. Some of them even participated in the ritual, ensuring that the blood spilled was enough to satisfy the ancient force that demanded it.

Leila’s accidental first kill had been anything but. She had been chosen, her fate sealed long before she had ever picked up the knife. But now she had a choice to make: embrace the role she had been given or fight back and try to end the cycle once and for all.

Epilogue: The Final Cut
The town of Briar Creek was quiet again, just like it had been before the killings started. The media had moved on, the survivors had begun to rebuild their lives, and the Slasher was dead.

At least, that’s what everyone believed.

But in the shadows of an empty street, beneath the cold light of a flickering streetlamp, a figure stood, watching the town with eyes that gleamed like the edge of a blade.

The Slasher was dead.

But the legacy wasn’t.

Chapter Two: The First Cut
Leila couldn’t remember the exact moment the knife had slipped into her hand, only the blur of adrenaline that followed. The alley had been dark, and Tyler Matthews had come out of nowhere. He had grabbed her — she remembered the sharp grip on her arm, the sound of his breath hot and angry in her ear. Panic had flooded her chest like ice, but somehow her hand had found the knife in her coat pocket.

Her father had given it to her years ago, a tool for protection he said. But it had always been more than that. Leila had felt its weight in her pocket countless times, reassured by its cold presence. Now, in the dim light of the alley, the blade was covered in blood.

Self-defense, she told herself, repeating it like a mantra. But deep down, she knew it wasn’t that simple. When the knife slashed through his skin, there had been something else — a spark, a rush of something too primal to name.

It wasn’t just fear that had driven her. It was something darker.

Chapter Three: Whispers in the Dark
Days passed after the incident, and the town buzzed with the news of Tyler Matthews’ death. It was ruled a tragic accident, a random act of violence in a town already gripped by fear. The Slasher, they said, had claimed another victim.

But Leila knew the truth.

She couldn’t sleep, couldn’t think. Her mind kept going back to the moment in the alley, the feel of the knife in her hand, the strange, exhilarating power that had come with it. But there was something else too, something she couldn’t explain. Since that night, she had started hearing whispers — not voices exactly, but fragments of thoughts, like someone else’s mind was brushing up against her own.

She tried to shake it off, but the more she ignored it, the louder it got.

Late one night, as she lay in bed staring at the ceiling, the whispering shifted, becoming clearer. It wasn’t just noise. It was a voice. And it was calling her by name.

Chapter Five: Ghosts in the Mirror
The killings had started long before the press had caught wind of them. Leila found that out while digging through old police reports, archived newspaper articles, and local rumors that had faded with time. In the 1980s, there had been a similar pattern — three murders, all done with the same surgical precision. The victims were different, but the method was identical. And then, as suddenly as it had begun, it had stopped.

Leila became obsessed with finding the link. The whispers in her mind grew more insistent, as if someone — or something — was guiding her to uncover the truth. Late one night, while staring at her own reflection in the bathroom mirror, she caught a glimpse of something behind her. A shadow, a figure just out of sight, watching her. She spun around, but there was no one there.

The whispers started again, but this time, they were words.

They see you now.

Chapter Seven: Bloodlines
The more Leila learned, the more she realized this wasn’t just random violence. It was something ancient, tied to Briar Creek’s history. Each cycle of killings matched up with major events in the town’s past — economic booms, political scandals, mysterious fires that had leveled parts of the city. Each time, the murders had marked a shift, like a sacrifice needed to reset the town’s future.

Leila discovered that each killer had ties to prominent families in the town. This wasn’t just coincidence; it was destiny. The Slasher wasn’t a random psychopath. It was a role passed down through generations, ensuring that Briar Creek stayed prosperous — at a terrible cost.

Her own family, the Graysons, had roots deep in the town’s foundation. And the deeper she dug, the more she realized that her father had known about the legacy. He had given her the knife, not as a tool of protection, but as a symbol — a passing of the torch.

Chapter Eight: Into the Woods
Leila started avoiding people. The guilt was too much. The connection between her family and the town’s bloody history weighed heavy on her mind. She couldn’t tell anyone — not her friends, not her family. No one would understand. No one could. But she wasn’t alone.

The Slasher was still out there, continuing his spree. Every few days, another body turned up, each one brutally killed in the same methodical manner. The police were scrambling, but no one seemed to be getting closer to the truth.

Then the dreams started.

Leila found herself wandering through dark forests in her sleep, the same woods that surrounded the town. She could feel something lurking just beyond the trees, watching her. Sometimes she heard footsteps, other times a low, growling breath. Each morning, she woke up more terrified than the last. But one night, instead of running, she followed the sound deeper into the woods.

In her dream, she found a clearing. At the center stood a figure, cloaked in shadows, holding a knife identical to hers. When the figure turned, she saw her own face staring back at her.

Chapter Nine: The Choice
It had been weeks since Leila killed Tyler Matthews, and she could still feel the weight of the knife in her hand, as though it had left a mark deeper than blood on her skin. She had fought the growing need, the dark impulse gnawing at her, but the truth had become undeniable: she was part of this now.

The voice in her head grew louder. The figure from her dreams had begun to bleed into her waking hours, appearing in the periphery of her vision, lingering at the edges of her life. The Slasher — or whoever, or whatever, had come before her — was watching, waiting for her to make her move.

But she wasn’t ready to submit to it. Not yet.

Leila stood at a crossroads. The legacy of the Slasher was inside her, pulling her towards a path she didn’t want to walk. But she knew, deep down, that running wouldn’t save her. She could fight it — try to stop the next killing before it happened — or she could let herself become the very thing she feared.

Chapter Eleven: A Killer’s Shadow
Leila wasn’t the only one in the crosshairs. Detective Harold Gray, one of the few cops left working on the Slasher case, had begun to notice strange things about Leila — how she always seemed to know more about the murders than she should, how her name appeared in the old records, tied to the town’s dark past.

He wasn’t sure if she was a suspect, a victim, or something worse. But the closer he got, the more tangled the web became. Briar Creek wasn’t just hiding a killer; it was harboring a secret that ran deeper than any of them knew.

Leila began to feel the pressure closing in on her. The police, the town, the Slasher — all of them converging towards a final confrontation. But the voice in her head was still there, whispering promises of power, urging her to embrace her destiny.

Chapter Twelve: Broken Chains
The town’s history was written in blood, but Leila was determined to break the cycle. She couldn’t let the murders continue. She couldn’t become the next Slasher. Armed with the truth, and the knowledge of her family’s role in the ritual, Leila sought out others who might help her — people on the fringes of the town’s past who had survived the previous cycles of killing.

Together, they formed a plan: stop the ritual, destroy the legacy of the Slasher once and for all. But as they closed in on the final steps, it became clear that something had been set in motion long before Leila had ever picked up the knife.

Some cycles, once started, couldn’t be broken.

Chapter Thirteen: The Last Victim
As the killings escalated, Leila realized the final victim had already been chosen. It wasn’t a random person, but someone central to the town’s survival. The ritual demanded a sacrifice, and the Slasher’s final kill was always someone tied to the history of Briar Creek itself — someone who would ensure that the town’s blood-soaked prosperity continued.

That person was Leila.

The Slasher was hunting her, just as she had been hunting him. But there was still a chance to end it. If she could survive the night, if she could stop the final ritual, she might be able to destroy the legacy forever.

Chapter Fourteen: The Final Cut
In a final showdown deep in the woods, Leila confronted the Slasher. The figure from her dreams was real, a man whose face was obscured by shadows, his identity hidden beneath layers of history. But as they fought, the truth became clear: the Slasher wasn’t just one person. It was a part of her, a dark mirror she had been fighting all along.

In the end, she realized that to destroy the Slasher, she would have to destroy the part of herself that had been marked by the legacy. She raised the knife, ready to make the final cut — not on the Slasher, but on herself.

But would she survive it?
