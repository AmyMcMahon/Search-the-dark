Title: After Birth
Author: Garth Margeni
Genre: Psychological Thriller / Speculative Fiction

Prologue

The world doesn’t begin at birth; it merely takes a new shape. Life, as we know it, is but a trick of the light, a fleeting shadow in the hallways of an unfathomable universe. This is a story about what comes after — not after life, but after the moment you think it begins.

Chapter One: Between Breaths
Alma stood over the crib, her fingers curling and uncurling at her sides, the soft rustle of her breath filling the quiet nursery. Outside, the wind hissed through the cracks in the old window, setting the curtains dancing like ghosts in the half-light. Her eyes never left the still form of the child below, wrapped in white muslin, a newborn that had yet to take its first breath.

Her heart pounded, as it always did in these moments, like a caged animal. The birth had been perfect — perfect, that is, in the way only a carefully orchestrated tragedy could be. Alma had followed the plan down to the smallest detail. She had done everything right.

But something had gone wrong.

The child had come into the world with its eyes wide open. No cry, no gasping breath to signal the start of life. Only those eyes, too wise for something so new, staring at her as though they knew far more than they should.

"Not again," she whispered, her voice barely audible, almost as if afraid the child could hear. She looked around, expecting shadows to emerge from the corners, watching her. "Not like the others..."

Chapter Three: The Quiet Ones
Alma wasn't the only one who had given birth to silence. In small pockets across the world, infants were being born in the same strange way — without breath, but alive in some other, unknowable manner. Some died shortly after birth, others lasted days or weeks, staring at the world with those haunting, knowing eyes. And a few simply disappeared, vanishing without a trace, leaving their mothers hollowed out and haunted.

The media hadn’t caught on yet, dismissing it as isolated incidents. But Alma knew better. It wasn’t just some tragic coincidence. It was happening for a reason, and it was spreading. Whatever these babies were, they weren’t human in the way we understand. They were something older, something far more dangerous.

As Alma tried to make sense of it all, a whisper began to ripple through the dark corners of the world — a prophecy, carried by those who had heard it through dreams or visions. These children, the ones who arrive silent and still, are not meant for this world. They are vessels, awaiting their true form. After birth, they become something else.

Chapter Six: The Cradle Between Worlds
The sky over Alma’s town grew darker every day, though the weather reports said otherwise. It was a subtle thing — a heaviness in the air, as if the fabric of the world had begun to stretch thin. People whispered about strange occurrences: animals fleeing into the forests and never coming back, children waking in the middle of the night speaking in languages they’d never learned.

And then there were the disappearances.

At first, it had been easy to explain away — runaway teens, a drifter passing through. But soon it became clear that entire families were vanishing, leaving their homes undisturbed. No signs of struggle, no indication of where they might have gone. Just empty houses, as though the people inside had simply stopped existing.

Alma knew it was connected to the babies — those silent, stillborn infants who weren't quite right. They weren’t gone. They were waiting. For what, she didn't know.

Chapter Ten: After Birth
The truth unraveled slowly, like a spool of thread pulling away from the world Alma thought she understood. The infants were part of something far older than humanity, a force that lived between life and death, between dimensions. They weren’t dead, but they weren’t truly alive either. They existed in the after birth, the space where creation loses its innocence and something darker takes over.

The children were vessels — not for souls, but for beings from another realm, waiting to be born into this world through the bodies of newborns. The disappearances, the strange happenings — they were all signs of the breach, a tear in reality that was widening with every passing day.

Alma knew that to stop it, she would have to confront the truth about her own child, the one who had been born with eyes too wise and a body too still. She wasn’t just a mother anymore; she was a gatekeeper, standing at the threshold of something too terrifying to comprehend.

Epilogue

It was quiet in the town now. The sky was clear again, and the air had returned to its usual weight. But Alma knew better. It wasn’t over. It never would be. The children of the after birth were still out there, watching and waiting, their eyes full of a terrible, ancient knowledge.

And in her dreams, she could hear them whispering, calling out for the day when they would finally claim the world that was theirs all along.
