**"Flay Bells Sting, Are You Glistening?" by Garth Marenghi**  

*Chapter 1: Tinsel Terror*  

The snow fell thick that night, each flake like a cold reminder of something long dead and forgotten. Whitewashed streets reflected the sickly glow of Christmas lights, twisted into patterns so garish they seemed more a mockery of the season than a celebration. Inside, the world festered in its own darkness, a darkness no amount of festive cheer could illuminate. And there, beneath the glistening frost, something stirred. Something ancient. Something hungry.

Eric Flebberton stood at the window of his apartment, watching the snow fall with a growing sense of dread. He didn’t know why. He’d always loved Christmas, hadn’t he? The cozy warmth of the fire, the gifts wrapped in bright paper, the smell of pine needles and cinnamon. But this year, something was different. The air was wrong, tinged with a tension he couldn’t quite place.  

He turned away from the window, his eyes catching the reflection of the tree he’d decorated only hours earlier. It stood in the corner of the room, its baubles glittering ominously in the half-light. Eric swallowed. There had been something unsettling about stringing those lights this year. The sharp tang of the tinsel had stung his fingers as if each metallic twist had a mind of its own. The ornaments, once harmless trinkets, now gleamed with a cruel intensity, their eyes—he shuddered at the thought—watching him.  

It was just the season getting to him, he reasoned. Stress. He’d been working long hours, after all. The corporate grind took its toll. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling. Something felt off, like a bell ringing in the distance, a flay bell, peeling with every chime.

A soft chime broke the silence. The clock on the mantel struck midnight. The hour of Christmas Eve. Eric’s skin prickled as the sound reverberated through the room. Outside, the snow had grown heavier, the world outside his window now smothered under a thick, suffocating blanket of white. The clock’s last chime hung in the air, stretching unnaturally long, as if the hands of time themselves were refusing to move forward. He stared at the clock, mesmerized, heart pounding. But why? Why should the sound of the clock be so terrifying?

Then came the knock at the door.

A simple knock. But not one you’d expect at such an hour. There was something… wrong with it. Too heavy. Too deliberate. Like whoever—or whatever—was on the other side knew more than just the rhythm of a polite rapping. Eric froze, staring at the door. 

*It’s late,* he thought, *too late for carolers or neighbors.* But the knock came again, louder this time. Each impact sent a shockwave through his spine. Slowly, reluctantly, Eric made his way to the door, his fingers trembling as they reached for the handle.

He opened it.

There was no one there.

But the cold was there. A biting, cruel cold that slashed through the warmth of his apartment, sending a shiver through his bones. The street outside was deserted, the only sound the soft crunch of snow underfoot. Eric was about to close the door when his eyes fell upon something at the threshold.

A package. Wrapped in red and gold paper, it gleamed unnaturally in the soft glow of the streetlight. No name. No note. Just the gift. 

He stared at it for a long moment, debating whether or not to bring it inside. His gut screamed against it, but curiosity tugged at his hands. He reached down, picked up the box, and brought it inside. It was heavier than it looked, cold to the touch, almost as if it had been left in a freezer.

With shaking fingers, Eric peeled back the paper.

Inside was a bell. A small silver bell, polished to an unnerving gleam. His reflection warped in its surface, bending and twisting like a funhouse mirror. There was something grotesque about seeing himself like that, something unnatural. His hand recoiled as though the bell had burned him. It hadn’t, of course. Not yet.

But Eric could feel it—the bell was watching him.

*Chapter 2: The Sound of Silence*

Eric didn’t sleep that night. He couldn’t. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the bell. Its silver surface glistening in the dark, its tiny clapper waiting to swing and unleash whatever unholy sound it harbored. He had placed it on the mantel, far from where he sat, yet he felt its presence, as though it were silently judging him. The snowstorm outside had grown worse, the winds howling like a wounded beast. The world outside was dead, silent but for the whistling wind. But inside, the silence was deafening.

Unable to take it anymore, Eric rose from his chair and crossed the room to the bell. His hand hovered over it, hesitant. The moment stretched out, his heartbeat pounding louder in his ears. Then, without thinking, he picked up the bell.

The air changed immediately, growing thicker, colder. His fingers, despite not wanting to, curled tighter around the handle, his thumb brushing the small clapper. He shouldn’t ring it. Every fiber of his being screamed at him not to, but his hand moved on its own. He shook it once, gently.

A single chime filled the room, soft but impossibly loud.

It was a sound that cut through the air, through his very soul, splitting reality from fantasy. For an eternity, nothing happened. And then, the world around him began to shift.

*Chapter 3: The Return of Krampus*  

The snow fell in sheets, each flake slicing through the air with a cruel edge. Eric stood frozen in place, the bell still in his hand, its weight feeling far heavier than before. He could sense it now, the thing that had stirred in the dark. Something ancient had been summoned. The world outside his window had transformed. The street was no longer recognizable, no longer the neighborhood he’d known his whole life. It was something... older, far older. Twisted.

From the snow, a figure emerged. Tall, gaunt, its face obscured by a tangle of dark hair and tattered robes. It moved with a deliberate slowness, the snow parting before it like water. As it neared, Eric could see the horns. 

Krampus.

The creature loomed over him, its eyes glowing with a malevolent light. Eric tried to move, to run, but his legs wouldn’t obey. He was rooted to the spot, frozen in terror. The creature reached out a long, clawed hand and touched the bell in Eric’s hand.

“You rang,” it rasped.

*Chapter 4: Glisten or Die*

Eric had no idea how long he’d been running. Time had ceased to have meaning. All that mattered now was escape. But escape from what? The streets twisted around him, becoming a maze of ice and shadow. The lights in the windows of the houses flickered out one by one as though the entire world was being swallowed by darkness. And behind him, always behind him, was Krampus. 

The bell in Eric’s hand throbbed with every step, its weight growing heavier as if the spirit of the season had somehow infused itself into the small object. The words *Are You Glistening?* echoed through his mind, mocking him.

Finally, he stumbled into an alleyway, collapsing against the wall, breath coming in ragged gasps. For a moment, just a moment, he thought he’d lost it. But the silence that followed was far worse than the chase. 

Out of the darkness, Krampus stepped forward, and this time, it wasn’t alone. The shadows came alive with other creatures, beings of frost and bone, gnarled hands reaching out. Eric clutched the bell tighter, instinctively raising it. He knew what he had to do.

With a final, desperate motion, he rang it.

The sound was deafening.

*Chapter 5: The Final Carol*  

Eric awoke in his apartment, the bell gone, the snowstorm outside reduced to a light dusting. Everything seemed normal again, but he knew better. Somewhere, in the depths of the frost, Krampus waited. The Christmas season would never be the same again.
