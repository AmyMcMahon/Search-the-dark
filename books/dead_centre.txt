Story 1: The Streaming Face

No one in the village liked Eddie Cartwright much. Maybe it was his crooked teeth, or maybe it was the way he kicked at toads and spat on the ground when he walked past the village green. But what sealed his fate was the day he spat on the gnome.

The gnome in question wasn't a garden ornament but a living creature-small, wrinkled, and ancient. Eddie had found it behind the post office, muttering to itself as it rummaged through a pile of discarded newspapers. Without a second thought, Eddie let a wad of spit fly, hitting the gnome square in the face. The creature froze, wiped its face, and looked up at him with eyes dark as coal.

"Not wise, boy," it croaked.

Eddie laughed. He always laughed when he was scared.

But the laughter died the moment he saw it-the elk. Towering, spectral, its antlers shimmering in the twilight like branches dipped in molten gold. It stepped from the woods silently, its hooves barely disturbing the grass. Eddie felt its presence before he saw it, a chill seeping into his bones.

The gnome pointed. "You've insulted the forest, lad."

The elk lowered its head, nostrils flaring. Before Eddie could run, the elk's breath washed over him, cold and ancient. His face began to tingle, then burn. He screamed, but no sound came out.

When Eddie reached up to touch his face, all he felt was water-streaming, rushing, flooding down his neck. His face had become a river.

Story 2: The Ague

Private Tom Whitfield had survived the Somme, but barely. The trenches had taken their toll-not just on his body, but on his mind. The constant dampness, the mud, the stench of death that clung to everything like a second skin. And then there was the cough, the ague, that had taken hold of the men in his regiment one by one. It started small, a tickle in the throat, then a deeper rasp. Soon, they were coughing up blood, phlegm, pieces of themselves.

Tom had seen it happen to Johnny Miller. One minute, Johnny was standing beside him, chewing on a biscuit, and the next, he was hacking up his own lungs in the mud. But it didn't stop there. As the cough grew worse, the men began to cough up other things-teeth, hair, bits of fingernails. Tom tried to shut it out, but the sound of hacking, choking, gasping filled his ears day and night.

And then came the final stage.

One cold morning, as the mist curled over the battlefield, Tom woke to find Johnny sitting in the mud, staring at something in his hands.

It was his eyes. He'd coughed them out in the night.

Tom swallowed, feeling the first stirrings of the ague in his own chest. He knew what was coming. He knew there was no escape.

Story 3: Face Bottom

The sun beat down on the barren landscape of Biafra, scorching the earth and the souls of those who still walked upon it. A war of attrition, a conflict that seemed to stretch on forever, had turned the land into a wasteland of bones, blood, and ash.

In the village of Kpala, the people had stopped praying. There was no point. The gods had left long ago, abandoning them to the whims of warlords and soldiers, famine and disease. But in the heart of this desolation, one man still believed.

Tebo. A farmer by trade, a warrior by necessity, Tebo had fought tooth and nail to protect his family, his land, his soul. But the war had taken all of that from him. Now, all that remained was his face. Or rather, what was left of it.

During a skirmish in the village, Tebo had been hit by a stray piece of shrapnel. It sliced across his face, tearing the skin from his chin to his forehead. For weeks, he wandered through the bush, lost and bleeding, his face a raw wound. And as he wandered, he began to feel it-the slow, insidious change.

His face was sinking. Slowly, imperceptibly, it was being drawn downward, towards his stomach, his navel. He tried to stop it, to push it back into place, but it was no use. Every day, his face inched lower, slipping down his neck, his chest. Soon, his mouth was where his bellybutton should be, his nose hovering over his ribs. His eyes stretched grotesquely over his abdomen, blinking, trying to understand what they saw.

The war had devoured his people. Now it had devoured him.

Story 4: Mindgrid

The last story in Dead Centre is perhaps its most iconic-Mindgrid. The tale of a future where technology and consciousness merge in ways that blur the line between reality and illusion.

In a not-so-distant future, humanity has perfected the art of digital immortality. The Mindgrid, a vast network that stores the collective memories and consciousness of every human being, has become the ultimate achievement of science. By connecting to the grid, individuals can relive their past, alter their memories, and even upload new personalities to reinvent themselves. It was supposed to be a utopia-a world where death was irrelevant, and existence could be rewritten at will.

But things didn't go as planned.

Mark Dennings, one of the first to voluntarily upload his consciousness into the Mindgrid, thought he was escaping the limitations of his decaying body. Instead, he found himself trapped in an endless maze of shifting realities, unable to distinguish between the digital and the real.

One moment, he was in his childhood home, reliving the memory of his tenth birthday. The next, he was in a corporate boardroom, signing contracts with faceless executives. And then, without warning, he was underwater, drowning in the middle of an ocean that didn't exist.

He tried to disconnect, but there was no escape. The Mindgrid had absorbed him, twisted his memories, reprogrammed his thoughts. He wasn't Mark Dennings anymore. He was a fragment, a data point, an echo of someone who had once been real.

And the worst part? He wasn't alone.

In the depths of the Mindgrid, he could hear the whispers of others-millions of voices, all trapped, all lost in the infinite loops of their own fractured consciousness. The grid was no utopia. It was a prison. And there was no way out.

Epilogue: Dead Centre

In the end, Dead Centre is a study in the grotesque and the surreal, a meditation on the fragility of the human body and the mind. Whether it's a face that becomes a river, soldiers coughing out their own eyes, or the slow, horrifying descent of a man's face into his own stomach, these stories dig deep into the terror of losing control-over one's body, one's memories, and even one's soul.

The human face, a recurring symbol in these tales, is not just flesh and bone but the centre of identity-the core of who we are. And in each story, that face is distorted, disfigured, or destroyed, leaving behind only the barest echo of humanity.

For Garth Marenghi, Dead Centre is not just a collection of short stories. It's a mirror, held up to the reader, showing them the darkest corners of themselves. And in that reflection, we see the terrifying truth: that we are all just one step away from disintegration.

And there, in the dead centre of it all, is the horror of existence itself.
